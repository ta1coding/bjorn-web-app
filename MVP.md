- New Features:

1) I implemented support for 3d models, fixing the previous website that only allowed for 2d images of shirts. Now the models are implemented and are shown as a carousel of different clothing items. 

2) I added a hover feature that would enlarge the models when a user hovers their mouse over their clothing item.

3) Added names/prices to each of the clothing items. 

Fixed Bugs:

1) At first there was still an issue with the 2d image of the shirt popping up on screen with the 3d carousel. I had to get rid of the feature and make sure that the 3d carousel worked as intended.

2) Fixed rendering issue with the projection of the 3D models

Next steps:

1) Fix lighting/sizing of clothing to your preference. Also, more clothing items would be nice.
